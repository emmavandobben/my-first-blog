 (?P<pk>\d+) Django will take everything that you place here and transfer it to a view as a variable called pk. \d :  it can only be a digit, not a letter. + : more then one digit. So something like http://127.0.0.1:8000/post// is not valid, but http://127.0.0.1:8000/post/1234567890/ is perfectly OK!
 / â€“ then we need a / again.
 
 That means if you enter http://127.0.0.1:8000/post/5/ into your browser, Django will understand that you are looking for a view called post_detail and transfer the information that pk equals 5 to that view.
 So Django expects in the view a function called post_detail now.
